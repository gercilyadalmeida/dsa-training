# Practice DSA and upgrade your coding skills by solving these problems!
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems designed to help you enhance your coding skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, practicing these problems will improve your problem-solving abilities and prepare you for technical interviews.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiramaru/algo_training.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd algo_training
```
You can then explore the various problem categories and start solving them using your preferred programming language.

## Create a sub-directory for your solutions
To keep your solutions organized, create a sub-directory named after your GitHub username inside the relevant problem category folder. For example:
```bash
mkdir -p exercises/exercice_1/solutions/your_name/{js,py,cpp}
```
replacing `your_name` with your actual name.

You can then add your solution files inside this directory.
