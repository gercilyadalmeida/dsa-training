# Exercise 5: Factorial

## Description
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a function.

## Input
A single integer N.

## Output
Print the factorial of N.

## Definition
The factorial of N (denoted as N!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to N.
- 0! = 1
- 1! = 1
- N! = N × (N-1) × (N-2) × ... × 1

## Examples
```
Input: 5
Output: 120
(Explanation: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)

Input: 0
Output: 1

Input: 3
Output: 6
(Explanation: 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6)
```

## Constraints
- N is a non-negative integer
- 0 <= N <= 20
